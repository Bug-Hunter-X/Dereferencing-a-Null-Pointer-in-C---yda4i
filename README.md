This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to assign a value to a memory location pointed to by a null pointer. This leads to undefined behavior, typically a segmentation fault.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version that includes a null pointer check to prevent the error.
